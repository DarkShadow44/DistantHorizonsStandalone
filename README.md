# What is Distant Horizons?

Distant Horizons is a mod which implements a [Level of Detail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)) system to Minecraft.\
This allows for far greater render distances without harming performance by gradually lowering the quality of distant terrain.

Below is a video demonstrating the system:
